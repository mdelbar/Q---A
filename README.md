Q & A
=====

Question and answer app. Designed as a vocabulary app, but can be used for pretty much any "question and answer" situation.
Allows you to create new .qanda files and enter the vocabulary to learn, and save them. After that you can open them to test yourself.

Creating new files to enter vocabulary
--------------------------------------
Create a new file via the File menu. This opens a new window and prompts you for the From and To languages.
After entering the languages you can start entering vocabulary. The "+" button or the Enter key will add a new line.
When you're done, you can save the file to the disk.

Opening files to check vocabulary
---------------------------------
You can Open a file from disk. A prompt will let you decide the direction (Left to Right shows you the From language, you fill in the To language).
When you have entered the fields to your satisfaction, you can click the Check Answers button to see if you were right.
Correct fields will light up green, incorrect ones will light up red.
You can also Add a file if you want. This allows you to load multiple files into a single session.

As an added bonus to prevent cheating (by simply opening the .qanda file and reading the solution), words are encrypted before storage.
Disclaimer: the encryption is a simple Caesar cypher, but that was enough to fool my little brother.
